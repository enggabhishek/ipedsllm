These data are applicable for institutions that do not have an open admissions policy for entering first-time students."
c2022dep,"This table contains the number of programs offered by type of program, level of award (certificate or degree), and distance education status. Type of program is categorized according to the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a detailed coding system for postsecondary instructional programs. Beginning in 2019-20, the less than 1-year certificate award level is divided into the following two award levels: certificates of less than 12 weeks and certificates of at least 12 weeks but less than 1 year. More detailed information on distance education was also added in 2019-20. This file contains multiple records per institution."
effy2022,"This table contains the unduplicated headcount of students enrolled over the 12-month period (July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022) for both undergraduate and graduate levels. Beginning with the 2019-20 data collected in 2020-21, undergraduate level headcounts are available by attendance status (full- and part-time) for both degree/certificate-seeking and nondegree/certificate-seeking students. Degree/certificate-seeking headcounts are further disaggregated by first-time, transfer-ins, and continuing student categories. These enrollment data are particularly valuable for institutions that use non-traditional calendar systems and offer short-term programs. Because this enrollment measure encompasses an entire year, it provides a more complete picture of the number of students these schools serve."
